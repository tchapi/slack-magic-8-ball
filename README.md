# Slack Magic-8-ball
_« Beseech and thou shall hath an answer »_

A Node.js server for [Slack](https://slack.com/) that randomly responds to trigger words on a channel, and changes behavior depending on who posts.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`,  `general.json.dist` to `general.json` and `messages.json.dist` to `messages.json` and make the relevant changes with your domain, api key and payload token, then add some messages, and you're ready to go !

An edition page is available at the root of the webserver, where you can modify the `messages.json` file.
